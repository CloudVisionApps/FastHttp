# FastHTTP

FastHTTP is a high-performance web server designed to handle multiple virtual hosts, each running PHP-FPM. It is built with speed and efficiency in mind, providing a robust solution for serving dynamic websites and applications.

## Features

- **Multiple Virtual Hosts**: Supports the configuration and management of multiple virtual hosts, making it easy to run multiple websites on the same server.
- **PHP-FPM Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with PHP-FPM for optimal performance in serving PHP applications.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed, ensuring minimal resource usage while handling large amounts of traffic.
- **Easy Configuration**: Simplified configuration process with intuitive syntax for managing server settings and virtual hosts.

## Installation

To install FastHTTP, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CloudVisionApps/FastHTTP.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd FastHTTP
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install required packages (e.g., PHP-FPM, etc.)
   sudo apt-get install php-fpm
   ```

4. Configure your virtual hosts by editing the `fasthttp.json` file.

## Usage

### Starting the Server

To start the FastHTTP web server, run the following command:

```bash
./fasthttp start
```

This will start the server and begin serving requests for your configured virtual hosts.

### Stopping the Server

To stop the FastHTTP web server, run the following command:

```bash
./fasthttp stop
```

This will gracefully shut down the server.

### Restarting the Server

To restart the FastHTTP web server (useful after configuration changes), run:

```bash
./fasthttp restart
```

This will stop and then immediately start the server again.

### Reloading the Configuration

To reload the configuration without restarting the entire server, use the following command:

```bash
./fasthttp reload
```

This will apply any changes made to the configuration files without downtime.

### Example Virtual Host Configuration

FastHTTP supports virtual hosts, allowing you to serve multiple websites from a single server. Hereâ€™s an example configuration for a virtual host:

```json
{
  "user": "fasthttp",
  "group": "fasthttp",
  "serverAdmin": "root@localhost",
  "httpPort": "80",
  "httpsPort": "443",
  "virtualHosts": [
    {
      "portType": "http",
      "serverName": "yourdomain.com",
      "documentRoot": "/home/yourdomain/public_html",
      "user": "yourdomain",
      "group": "yourdomain",
      "phpProxyFCGI": "127.0.0.1:9094"
    },
    {
      "portType": "https",
      "serverName": "yourdomain.com",
      "documentRoot": "/home/yourdomain/public_html",
      "user": "yourdomain",
      "group": "yourdomain",
      "phpProxyFCGI": "127.0.0.1:9094",
      "ssl": {
        "enabled": true,
        "certificateFile": "/etc/ssl/certs/yourdomain.crt",
        "certificateKeyFile": "/etc/ssl/private/yourdomain.key"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

- **serverName**: The domain or IP address for the virtual host.
- **documentRoot**: The directory where the website files are stored.
- **user**: The user under which the website should run.
- **group**: The group under which the website should run.
- **phpProxyFCGI**: The PHP-FPM server address to handle PHP requests.
- **ssl**: Configuration for enabling SSL.
  - **enabled**: Whether SSL is enabled for the virtual host.
  - **certificateFile**: The path to the SSL certificate file.
  - **certificateKeyFile**: The path to the SSL certificate key file.
 
### Access Logs

FastHTTP logs all requests to a log file, which you can find in the `/var/log/fasthttp/` directory by default. You can monitor these logs to troubleshoot and analyze traffic.

```bash
tail -f /var/log/fasthttp/access.log
```

### Testing Configuration

Before restarting the server after making changes to the configuration file, you can test if your configuration is valid with:

```bash
./fasthttp configtest
```

This will check the configuration syntax and output any errors or warnings.
